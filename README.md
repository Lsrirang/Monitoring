# Monitoring Setup with Prometheus and Grafana

## Introduction
This sets up a complete monitoring and alerting system for docker containers using **Prometheus, Grafana** and **Alertmanager** to help track our infrastructure's health and performance in real time.

With **Prometheus**, we gather and store time-series data about system resources like CPU, memory, disk and network usage. **Grafana** helps us to vizualize all the data that we gather from Prometheus. We can interact with the data, making it easy to get trends, identify issues and track performance over time. if something goes wrong, the **Alertmanager** sends alerts to notify us based on the alert rules that we set. by this we can ensure to respond quickly to any critical situations.

In this assessment, **Node Exporter** collects important metrics from the host system, while cAdvisor collects metrics from the containers. Together, they provide a full picture of both underlying hardware and the docker containers running on top of the host machine.

The project is designed to be scalable and flexible, suitable for anything from a small test system to a full production system. whether we are monitoring few containers or a whole infrastructure, this helps to find performance issues and minimizing downtime. 

## Tools Used
- Prometheus
- Alertmanager
- Grafana
- Node Exporter
- cAdvisor
- Docker and Docker compose
- Slack

## Setup
Basic requirements for instance:
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2 (5.1 Kernel)
- Instance Type: t2.micro
- Security Group: Open ports 22, 3000, 3001, 8080, 9090, 9093, 9100
- Key Pair: Create or select one for SSH access

## ðŸ”— Slack Webhook Setup

To enable Slack alert notifications via Alertmanager, follow these steps:

### Create a Slack Webhook

1. Visit [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)  
2. Click **Create New App** â†’ choose **From Scratch**
3. Give your app a name and select your workspace
4. In the left sidebar, go to **Incoming Webhooks**
5. Toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **On**
6. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
7. Select the desired Slack channel (e.g., `#alerts`) and click **Allow**
8. Copy the generated **Webhook URL**

### Find Your Webhook URL Later

To retrieve your webhook URL anytime:

- Go to [Your Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
- Click on your created app
- Navigate to **Incoming Webhooks**
- Your Webhook URLs will be listed under **Webhook URLs for Your Workspace**

Follow these steps to quickly set up the environment:

To download the `setupscript.sh` file directly from the GitHub repository, use the following command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lsrirang/Monitoring/master/setupscript.sh
bash setupscript.sh```

## for manual setup

### 1. Install Docker
<pre>
$ sudo yum update -y
$ sudo yum install docker -y
$ sudo systemctl start docker
</pre>

### 2. Install Docker Compose
<pre> 
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ ls /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ docker-compose version
</pre>

### 3. Install Git
<pre>
$ sudo yum install git -y
</pre>

### Clone the Repository
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Lsrirang/Monitoring.git

cd Monitoring

git checkout master

# Open the Alertmanager configuration file to update your Slack settings slack_webhook_url and channel
vim alertmanager.yml 

```

### Start the containers
<pre>
 $ sudo docker-compose up -d 
</pre>


### Access the containers with the ports
- Prometheus - http://<public-ip-addr>:9090
- Grafana - http://<public-ip-addr>:3000
- Alertmanager - http://<public-ip-addr>:9093
- Zomatoapp(node.js) - http://<public-ip-addr>:3001

## Setting up Grafana for visualization
### Login to Grafana
- Username: admin
- Password: admin
- you will be asked to change the password

### Add Prometheus as a Data Source
- **Data Source** -> add data source
- Choose Prometheus
- Set the URL to http://<public-ip-addr>:9090
- Select Save and Test (you can see a message that data source is working in green)

### Import a Dashboard
- Top left click + icon -> import Dashboard
- Enter dashboard ID 193/1860 for docker container/node exporter full
- Select Prometheus as the Data Source
- click on Import

## Alerts set in the project
Prometheus will trigger alerts based on the rules that are mentioned in alert.rules. when the alerts are active/fired these are forwarded to Alertmanager which then sends them to the Slack. To make sure that our alert setup is working (to check integration between Prometheus, Alertmanager and slack), i have set a dummy alert that fires always.
## Node Exporter Alerts
### Alert                   Description
HostHighCPUUsage            CPU usage > 85% for 2 minutes
HostHighMemoryUsage         Memory usage > 90%
HostDiskFull                Disk usage > 90%
NodeDown                    Node Exporter is down

## cAdvisor Alerts
### Alert	                       Description
ContainerHighCPUUsage	       Container CPU > 85%
ContainerHighMemoryUsage	   Container memory > 90%
ContainerRestartLoop	       Restart count > 1 in 5 minutes
cAdvisorDown	               cAdvisor not reachable
DummyAlwaysFiringAlert	     Always firing (for testing purpose only)

## Future Developments
- in this project we are monitoring system and container health only. we have deployed a Node.js application, we can also monitor at the application level by tracking things like API response times, error rates, and queue size.
- if we are deploying this to production we have to lock it down by adding OAuth to secure access to Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager.
- we can automate everything with terraform to make the monitoring stack reusable and version controlled to save errors made by human.
